# Coding Challenge 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Overview
This coding challenge is designed to test your understanding and ability to implement core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. You will create a small system to manage different types of animals in a virtual zoo, demonstrating concepts such as classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement OOP principles.
- Develop classes using inheritance and polymorphism to simplify and reuse code.
- Apply encapsulation to protect the data within a class.
- Use abstraction to design a common interface for various classes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- An IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [URL of the repository]
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd coding-challenge-1
   ```
3. Compile and run the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Tasks
Your main task is to develop a set of classes that represent different types of animals in a zoo. Below are the specific requirements for the classes and their behaviors:

### Base Class: `Animal`
- **Attributes**: `name`, `age`
- **Methods**: `eat()`, `sleep()`

### Derived Classes
You need to create at least three derived classes (e.g., `Lion`, `Elephant`, `Bird`). Each class should override the `eat` and `sleep` methods to reflect specific behaviors.

### Interface: `AnimalBehavior`
Implement the `AnimalBehavior` interface in your derived classes with the following methods:
- `makeSound()`: Outputs a sound specific to the animal.
- `move()`: Describes how the animal moves.

### Encapsulation
Ensure all attributes are appropriately encapsulated with public getters and setters.

### Testing
Write unit tests for each class to ensure methods perform as expected. Example tests are provided in the `src/test/java` directory.

## Submission Guidelines
After completing the assignment, make sure to push your final changes to your GitHub repository and submit the link to Canvas:
1. Add all your changes to git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Complete coding challenge 1"
   ```
3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
